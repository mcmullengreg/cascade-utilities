`gallery` allows for image content to be dropped onto a page, without the need for additional code knowledge.
{{</lead>}}

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

To create a gallery, you will need to create a gallery block. The block will allow you to choose up to 6 items (4 items are the minimum for a "Masonic" type layout). Although an image carousel can also be selected, which will allow for images to be captioned.

### Shortcode

{{<code lang="html">}}
<p>[gallery path="/_blocks/path-to-gallery"]</p>
{{</code>}}

## Notes

As previously stated, all shortcodes require a paragraph tag to surround the tag. Content can be above or below the shortcode, but shortcodes should live on their own content line.
